    <h2>SEO Techniques</h2>
    <p><strong>Keyword Research and Long-Tail Keywords:</strong> Understanding search intent and targeting long-tail keywords can significantly boost website traffic. While popular keywords often have higher competition, long-tail keywords, which are more specific and less competitive, can drive more qualified traffic (Zviadadze, 2024). For example, instead of targeting "shoes," aiming for "best price red women's size 7 running shoe" may lead to better conversions.</p>
    <p><strong>Technical SEO Optimization:</strong> Improving site architecture, fixing broken links, and ensuring a mobile-friendly design are critical to enhancing search rankings. Optimized technical elements help search engine crawlers index the site efficiently, leading to better visibility (Zviadadze, 2024).</p>
    <p><strong>Content Optimization for Search Intent:</strong> Creating content that aligns with the user's search intent—informational, navigational, transactional, or commercial—ensures that visitors find what they need on your site. Matching content to intent increases user satisfaction and boosts rankings (Zviadadze, 2024).</p>

    <h2>SMO Techniques</h2>
    <p><strong>Use Hashtags Strategically:</strong> Hashtags categorize content, making it discoverable on social media. By using relevant and trending hashtags, you can reach a broader audience. This helps boost engagement by connecting your posts with users interested in specific topics, improving visibility and driving traffic (eClincher, 2024).</p>
    <p><strong>Post Consistently:</strong> Regular posting keeps your content in front of your audience and ensures that your brand remains visible. Consistent updates not only maintain engagement but also help you build a loyal following. Scheduling posts during peak times can maximize reach and interactions (eClincher, 2024).</p>
    <p><strong>Leverage Social Media Analytics:</strong> Social media analytics provide valuable insights into which content performs best. By analyzing engagement rates, audience demographics, and content trends, you can fine-tune your strategy. This helps ensure that future posts are more effective in reaching your target audience and driving engagement (eClincher, 2024).</p>
